## Experiment 2 - Numerical Phyton(Numpy)
Normalization Problem 

- create a random 5 x 5 ndarray and store it to variable X. Normalize X. Save your normalized 
ndarray as X_normalized.npy

Divisible By 3 Problem

- Create a 10 X 10 ndarray which are the squares of first 100 positive integers. From this ndarray, determine all the elements that are divisible by 3. Save the result as div_by_3.npy
